Many people are under the impression that interventions are dramatic encounters that are designed to force an individual suffering from addiction into treatment. This belief is due in large part to the prevalence of television shows that depict interventions in this way. Negative associations with interventions and their outcomes can be dangerous for addicts and their loved ones, so it is important to educate yourself and others about what an intervention is and how it is conducted properly.  
  
There is a wide range of addiction types and our interventionists are trained to expertly handle a variety of addictions including but not limited to drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, online gaming, and shopping.  
  
As well, our interventionists are trained counselors able to help as Sober Living Coaches and with Couples' Counseling.  
  
Real interventions are very different from their television portrayals. They usually involve much less drama, rarely deliver ultimatums, and often involve more than one meeting between family members and an addicted individual. An intervention is a carefully planned encounter designed to gently confront an addict about their behavior and encourage them to seek help in a rehab facility.  
  
Addicts must seek treatment of their own volition to have the best chance of a successful recovery. An intervention that is facilitated by an intervention counselor might be the best option for somebody wishing to help a loved one understand how his or her addiction is affecting the family and friends of the addict. If you are looking for an intervention counselor, don't suffer any longer. Please reach out to us today.
